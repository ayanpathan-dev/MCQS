*
0/1
1. B/B+ trees grow upward while Binary Search Trees grow downward.
2. Time complexity of search operation in B/B+ tree is better than Red Black Trees in general.
3. Number of child pointers in a B/B+ tree node is always equals to number of keys in it plus one.
 
4. A B/B+ tree is defined by a term minimum degree. And minimum degree depends on hard disk block size, key and address sizes.
